# contacting Aaron Hopkins
Hello Hopkins
I hope you are doing well.

I am Mashood Ali, a web developer based in India.

I tried to contact you through email and on linkedin but
you haven't replied. I have only left with this means to contact you.

Actually I am looking to either buy your domain name die(DOT)net or to take it on monthly lease. On lease basis, the domain will remain with you and I will pay you on monthly basis for using it.

I am intending to make die(DOT)net a more helpful guide website for developers and coders.

I will keep the original content and home page as it is (if you want) and will upload new content in a separate folder.

The monthly lease fee can be discussed further.

Kindly reply my email with your opinion on my proposal. Even if you have other proposal or not agree with me, kindly reply to me for my acknowledgement.

Anyway, your domain die(DOT)net is going to expire within a week. Kindly renew it.



Thanks
Mashood Ali
