# contact-project
Hello Sergiusz Pawlowicz,

I hope you are doing well

I tried my best to contact you through various means like linkedIn, websites(random.re) but failed. I tried to start a chat with you from my original github account but you have blocked me.
Now, i am trying to contact you through this way.

The website The Linux Documentation Project is dead now. It seems that you have lost interest in the site.

I have a proposal for the site.
I want to take the website on lease and want to make it a more useful resource for the developers and coders.
I will keep the original content as it is and will upload new content in a separate folder keeping the home page as it is (if you want) so that no one will notice that the site owner has changed.

The monthly lease fee for using the domain can be discussed further if you agree on the proposal.

The TLDP is like an old garage and all the contents on it are non-updated. It does not serve the demand of today's developer. Why not make some money utilizing it. 

Kindly reply to my proposal. Even if you have a different proposal, kindly notify me through my mail.
I also tried to contact Guylhem Aznar, but failed as he has changed his name and there is no way to contact him.

Thanks
